## About

This is my personal portfolio project built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).  
It uses several frameworks and libraries including GSAP, Three.js, Fullpage.js, TailwindCSS, and Typescript.
